### Project

Project for Unit 5 - Required for successful completion of the Front End Nanodegree at Udacity. The project is a web application that incorporates the BooksAPI created by Udacity with the creation of user interfaces via React.js. This application is a reading consortium which allows a user to search the books database and from that database indicate which books they are reading, would like to read, and have read. The user is able to search via the search functionality and search bar and then can use drop down menus to select the indicated reading states and place the books on those corresponding bookshelves.
